##**How to play**
---
The object of the game is to score as many points as possible. To do this, you must move your character across the screen and reach the water without getting killed by the bugs. There are several items that will appear which will give you additional points or lives.

##**Controls**
---
To move your character, use the arrow keys. Alternatively you can use 'W' 'A' 'S' 'D' to move up, left, down, or right.
To change your character, use the numbers 1 through 5 to pick a different avatar.
To pause the game, press the 'P' key.
To start a new game, press the 'R' key. Note: this only works after your game has ended.

##**Scoring**
---
Items appear randomly throughout the game for a limited amount of time before disappearing. Each item has a base score value plus an additional bonus modifier. The bonus modifier is added to the score and is based on the amount of time left before an item disappears. The sooner you get an item, the higher the bonus modifier.

There is an additional bonus modifier that is added to the score when you reach the water. This is based on the amount of time spent in the active game area. The active game area is anywhere except for the first starting row. If you go back to the starting row, the bonus modifier is reset. The longer the amount of time spent in the active game area, the higher the bonus.

* Gems (any color)			25pts
* Keys						75pts
* Hearts					100pts plus an additional life
* Stars						125pts
* Stones					125pts
* Reaching the water		100pts
* Hit by bug				Minus 100pts and lose a life

##**Hints**
---
Try to get the items as quick as possible to get a higher bonus. The longer you stay alive in the active game area, the higher the bonus you'll get when reaching the water. The game gets progressively harder each time you reach the water.
